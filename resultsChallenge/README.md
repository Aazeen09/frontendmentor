# Frontend Mentor - Results summary component solution
This is a solution to the [Results summary component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV). 

# The challenge
The main challenge is to re-create the design as closely as possible to the brief. Since I do not have the pro-version, I did not have access to the figma files. I only used the provided screenshots to complete the challenge. 
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

# My process
I started with designing the mobile layout first. I used flexbox and experimented with placement until it matched the design. Next, I added a media query to build the web layout.After submitting my solution, I found some errors. I made revisions and used CSS validators and HTML validators to check for errors. Finally, I wrote the documentation (this document) to help me remember my learning process.

# Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

# What I learned
I learned that it is possible to create a project that might seem overwhelming at first. When I first saw the this challenge under "newbie" I was really intimidated. I thought "there is no way I can make this work!" but I did! I am proud of the results! My biggest take away to tackle a project one step at a time, and one problem at a time. Every big task can be broken down into smaller, more manageable components. 

# Continued development
I want to learn more about accessibility, and how to make my projects accessible to as many users as possible. 

# Useful resources
I used these free tools to check for errors in my markup.
